retina
======

Tools for visualizing and comparing retinal cell density data.


Overview
======
After measuring the density of retinal ganglion cells on the rear surface of the eye under microscope:

Use **retina** to

  Import retinal cell density data collected under microscope
  
  Reinstate the hemispherical shape of the data (making use of the retistruct package[Sterratt et al 2013])
  
  Assign the data to a 'retina object' which can be
  
    combined with other retinas to make a species/specimen average
    
      'Spin Opimization' (optional) to ensure proper orientation across samples.
      
    Custom-smoothed with a Thin Plate Spline interpolator
    
    Projected into 2d space with an azimuthal equidistant transformation
    
    Visualized with a contoured topographic heat-map
    
      Carefully designed to be readable by viewers who may have colorblindness or black-and-white photocopiers.
