\title{Rotation error measurement for two similar retinal maps.}
\usage{
rotation_optimize(map1, map2, spatial_res = 32, theta_interval = 30, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{map1}{retinal data: This map will not be rotated,
  and will serve as the reference.}

  \item{map2}{retinal data: This map will be rotated and
  superimposed upon map1. Has components $x, $y and $z in
  azimuthal projection coordinates.}

  \item{spatial_res}{Defines the number of pixels across
  the interpolation grid for every comparison. Default is
  16 for speed.}

  \item{theta_interval}{Defines the interval at which the
  rotation value will be changed when moving to the next
  comparison. Default is 10 in units of degrees.}

  \item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other
  methods. reference map. latitude in [,1], longitude in
  [,2], rho in [,3].}
}
\value{
df_spin Matrix of errors (in second column) for a given map
rotation.
}
\description{
Rotates one map 360 degrees, and for every value of
rotation between -180 to 180, the mean absolute difference
between the maps' rho values is recorded
