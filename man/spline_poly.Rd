\usage{
spline_poly(xy_dataframe, vertices, k = 3, ...)

spline_poly(xy_dataframe, vertices, k = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy_dataframe}{xy dataframe coordinates, in two columns.}

\item{vertices}{Number of spline vertices to create.}

\item{k}{Wraps K vertices around each end. n >=k}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{xy}{vertices in dataframe with x and y columns, in order (not all are used).}

\item{k}{number of points to wrap around ends to obtain smooth spline}

\item{...}{further arguments to spline}
}
\value{
Coords More finely placed vertices for the polygon.

xy_dataframe_splined xy dataframe coordinates, in two columns, with new points from spline.
}
\description{
Useful for making the falciform process look more smooth and refined. This is purely aesthetic.

The rows of 'xy' give coordinates of the boundary
vertices, in order.  'vertices' is the number of spline vertices to create.
(Not all are used: some are clipped from the ends.)  'k' is the number of
points to wrap around the ends to obtain a smooth periodic spline.  reference:

Returns an array of points.
}
\details{
enhance the resolution of a polygon vertices dataframe by creating a spline along each vertex.
