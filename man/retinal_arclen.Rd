retinal_arclen(ED)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ED}{Eye Diameter of the eye sample, measured at the
  widest point of the eye.}
}
\value{
Retinal Arclength in millimeters
}
\description{
Calculates the retinal perimeter distance [mm], with the
assumption that the retinal shape is hemispherical.
}
\details{
Assumes a spherical eye, where eye diameter approximates
twice the sphere's radius.
