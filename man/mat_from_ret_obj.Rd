\title{Extract a matrix from a retinal object}
\usage{
mat_from_ret_obj(retina_object, rotation = 0, n = 1, reflect = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{retina_object}{A retina}

  \item{rotation}{in degrees. By default 0; set to zero
  rotation.}

  \item{n}{the number by which to divide the matrix by.
  Useful when generating partial averages.}

  \item{reflect}{logical, by default it is TRUE, in order
  to view the retina from outside the eye (rather than from
  within.)}

  \item{...}{Other arguments passed from other functions}
}
\value{
mat A square matrix of the evaluated retina fit.
}
\description{
You can decide how much to rotate the retina before
returning the matrix. You can also pass arguments to the
polar plotter.
