\title{Retina Plot}
\usage{
retinaplot(retina_object, spatial_res = 1000, rotation = 0,
  inner_eye_view = TRUE, return_fit = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{retina_object}{A list containing an element \code{azimuthal_data.datapoints} with
\code{x,y,z} datapoints. File must also include \code{azimuthal_data.falciform}.}

\item{spatial_res}{define the number of pixels (resolution) the plot will be}

\item{rotation}{degrees to rotate CCW (int or floating point)}

\item{inner_eye_view}{boolean, default is TRUE. If set to false, the plotted view of the retina will have the viewpoint within the skull looking at the rear of the eye. inner_eye_view has the same view as the traditional wholemount.}

\item{return_fit}{logical, whether or not to return the interpolation fit data.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
Base-R polar plot
}
\description{
\code{retinaplot} Generates an Azimuthal Equidistant plot projection of a retina object.
You can also set lambda(floating point number) and polynomial_m(integer), as well as extrapolate (TRUE, FALSE).
