Title: Tools for plotting and analyzing vertebrate retinas
Description: This repository represents an effort to make retinal data comparable and replicable. Flat-mounts or Wholemounts are the retina specimens that are generated from vertebrates, but it's challenging to combine data and make quantitative comparisons. Our package solves this problem.
